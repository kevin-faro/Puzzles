Java Puzzles

A collection of puzzles I worked out in java. 

1 - TransposedBinarySearch: Given a sorted list that has been transposed that is, a portion has been removed from one end and attached to the other write a function to determine if a given number is present in the list.

2 - PassTriangle: By starting at the top of the triangle and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom.  See comments for example.

3 - RandomWithDistribution: Provided a Map of Strings and distributions, a random string will be returned with probability proportional to its distribution.
